    <p>Over 72 years of cumulative judgment based on practical experience is the most important part of the service Pearl and Levy provides. Experience, skill, dedication and imagination are the methods we apply to deliver the best possible client services.  But it doesn’t end there. </p>
    
    <p>Pearl and Levy is committed not only to giving the best professional advise and first class service, but also to being easy to work with.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>We seek to continually improve all aspects of the service we provide to clients.</li>
        <li>We make it our business to fully understand your legal needs and your goals.</li>
        <li>We communicate with you frequently.  Our goal is to respond to telephone calls and E-mails from clients within 24 hours of receipt.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are a service business.  Quality of advice is  paramount, but so is service. Service to us means establishing at the outset a good working relationship with the client. At Pearl and Levy each client is kept fully informed of developments with regular updates, enabling the client to keep abreast of the status of his/her case. We establish relationships with our clients which extend beyond the provision of the legal services.  Many of our clients consider us to be personal friends and advisors. </p>

    <p>Pearl and Levy concentrates its law practice in the northern counties of New Jersey where we have excellent relationships with the trial bench and bar and are well known to local administrative officials.  The counties where we practice include:  Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Sussex, Union, and Warren.</p>

    <p>Bernard Pearl has, since the firm’s inception, collected more than forty-five million dollars compensation for our personal injury clients. See attached case highlights for some of our larger settlements.</p>

    <p>Edward S. Levy has handled over 3,000 residential and commercial closings in his career.  He has handled multimillion dollar commercial closings including the purchase and sale of pharmacies, restaurants, medical practices, and many other types of businesses.  He handles all aspects of residential closings, including contract negotiations, resolving all inspection issues, ordering title and survey, interfacing with the lender and doing everything that is necessary to facilitate a smooth and efficient closing.  Mr Levy is a very "hands on" attorney who does not delegate important responsibilities to others.  Mr. Levy will make sure there are no surprises at closing. </p>

    <p>We are also highly experienced in the fields of collections, wills, municipal court maters and commercial litigation.</p>
